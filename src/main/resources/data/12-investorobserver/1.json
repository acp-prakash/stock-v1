Science defines who we are. It is why we come to work every day and is part of our DNA. But this is only half of the story. We know that we do not have all the answers. We want to share ideas because we believe it results in better medicines. We want the way we work to be inclusive open and collaborative. This approach runs through all that we do. We focus on three main therapy areas Oncology Cardiovascular & Metabolic Disease CVMD and Respiratory and we are also selectively active in the areas of autoimmunity neuroscience and infection. To put ourselves in the best position to push the boundaries of science we seek to leverage our combination of capabilities which encompass both small molecules and biologics and include immunotherapies and developing innovative delivery devices that can offer choice to patients. These are reinforced by a strong focus on personalised healthcare capabilities which aim to match medicines only to those patients who will benefit from them. Our teams also work alongside the worlds leading academic and biotech research institutions to stimulate innovation and evaluate emerging technologies such as Modified RNA and CRISPR genome editing. AstraZeneca operates in over 100 countries and its innovative medicines are used by millions of patients worldwide. For more information visit www.astrazeneca.com.",
